## Development Timeline
### Account Functionality
This project started with account settings: signing up, in, out, and changing passwords.

### Game Functionality
Then, it gradually got more difficult when building the game from the ground up. The grid was easy in the beginning, the API calls in the middle took a little trouble-shooting, and the winner-check function at the end was a weekend of headache. Alas, I worked through it adding new trouble-shooting techniques along the way.

## Problem-Solving Strategies
I've found some trouble-shooting or problem-solving Strategies along the way: At the beginning of every function, I would console.log() in order to see if I truly made it to that function. Another technique I liked was adding a last else {console.log('nothing worked')} at the end of a loop to see if the loop truly worked or if literally nothing worked.

## Unsolved issues
Once logged in, all of the user interactions are at the left-hand side of the page. This is something that could be fixed with a few hours working on css styling.
